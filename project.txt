* flatpak on the vps: issues #28

============================== MAYBE/SOMEDAY ==================================

* reconfigure gamepad buttons (as for keyboard ones)
  * joypad's commands in the loading menu
* force feedback on crash and weapon
* sometimes the vibration is not cleaned after a skidmark
* fix ai
* appimage packages
* use both keyboard and gamepads concurrently (show gamepad's command if connected)
* remove camera's render_all workaround
* remove dependency: pyyaml (configparser+json)
* remove dependency: bson (struct)
  * refactor the server (async.io) or
      def update(): ... threading.Timer(.5, update).start()
* use python's logging in place of eng.log
* add inertia to the camera (more info on freegamer), then improve rear camera
* https://discourse.panda3d.org/t/sample-using-directional-lights-shadows-effectively/24424
* load the car and the track from a single file
* improve online multiplayer's end of race (print realtime ranking, show
    bigger minimap)
* gui: do a single page for configuring the race (less testing)
* refactoring: do event/observer for joystick buttons
* class Player (has-a car, has-a driver)
* where proper (i.e. where observers aren't tied to the observable) replace
    observer with publisher-subscriber
* attach/attach_obs, detach/detach_obs - the client attach-es it to the
    observed, then it attach-es it to the component
* notify's sender (see page.py)
* object's creation: isolate the parallel creation and construct object in the
     standard way (fields) and use the parallel creation only when it is useful
  * facade, pass a single list (meth for callables, prop for others)
* lib/p3d/gui.py, lib/p3d/gfx.py: __init__ method from a non direct base class
    'Facade' is called
* remove eng.server
* racing should be another package in another submodule (i.e. yorg contains
   yyagl/ and racing/)
* yyagl's scons
* unit tests
